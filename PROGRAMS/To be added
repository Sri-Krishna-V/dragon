To further enhance the functionality and user experience of the program, you can consider adding the following features:

1. Password validation: Implement a password validation mechanism to ensure that users enter a strong and secure password for encryption and decryption.

2. Progress indicators: Display progress indicators or a progress bar to indicate the progress of file encryption and decryption operations, especially for larger files.

3. Drag and drop functionality: Allow users to drag and drop files directly onto the program window for encryption or decryption, providing a more intuitive and convenient way to handle files.

4. File validation: Perform validation checks on selected files to ensure they are valid text files before proceeding with encryption or decryption.

5. Error handling: Implement proper error handling and display meaningful error messages when file operations fail, passwords are incorrect, or any other unexpected errors occur.

6. Support for multiple file formats: Extend the program's functionality to support encryption and decryption of various file formats, not just text files. This can include documents, images, audio files, etc.

7. User preferences: Provide options for users to customize program settings, such as default file paths, encryption algorithms, or theme preferences.

8. File integrity checks: Implement checksum or hash functions to verify the integrity of decrypted files and detect any potential tampering or corruption.

9. History log: Maintain a log of encryption and decryption operations, including timestamps and file details, to keep track of user activities and provide a reference for future use.

10. Internationalization support: Make the program multilingual by implementing language localization features, allowing users to choose their preferred language.

Remember to prioritize user-friendly interfaces, error handling, and robust security measures when adding new features to ensure a seamless and secure user experience.
